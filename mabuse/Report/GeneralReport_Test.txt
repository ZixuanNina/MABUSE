365 day time step
Section2: 
time interval | the # of nodes at the current time step | the # of edges at the current time step | the # of edges lost over the last 365-day interval | the # of edges gained over the last 365-day interval | the # of nodes gained over the last 365-day interval | the # of nodes lost over the last 365-day interval
